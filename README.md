Authored by Aaron Filson, Oct 5th, 2015.

Update 1 added cookie counting functionality, and wrote it to the website.

Update 2 added a css stylesheet and a style guide.

Update 3 added the object constructor CookieStand, and refactored the code to use it.
The constructor also calls the cookie function, and sends the info to the website.
